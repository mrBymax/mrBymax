## About

Since 2022, I’ve been studying Computer Science at the University of Udine and exploring the intersection of software engineering, systems design, and cybersecurity. 

I've always loved competitive programming and solving algorithmic problems. I am around ~1600 rating on LC contests and looking for improvements. In the future I plan to shift to a more contest-oriented preparation through LC's and Codeforces' platforms. 

As part of @MadrHacks, I’ve achieved top global CTF rankings (1st in Italy, 37th worldwide) while mentoring students and building projects spanning distributed systems, databases, and machine learning. My focus is on scalable architectures, algorithms, and backend systems that combine technical precision with real-world impact.

I fell in love with CP in high school, and, since then, I've never stopped exploring and competing in various competitions.
Below you can find some statistics about my CP journey.
